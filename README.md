# Course Project - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The goal is to reconstruct the snooker table and balls from side view starting from a video. Specifically, the tasks are:
 1. pre-process video and filter only those frames that show side view;
 2. reconstruct camera position;
 3. reconstruct ball positions;
 4. automatically detect balls;
 5. find 2D patterns among the red balls.

To run the main script:
'''
	git clone https://github.com/okamiRvS/CVPR-project.git
	cd CVPR-project/script
	python3 main.py
